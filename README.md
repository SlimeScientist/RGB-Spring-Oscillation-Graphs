# RGB-Spring-Oscillation-Graphs
This Code creates the position vs time graph of a spring oscillating up and down. (imagine a spring connected to the ceiling and a mass on the other end.) This code uses Euler-Cromer to calculate its position over time.
The starting hieght of the spring is iterated by .1 and each new plot is given a unique RGB color. Once finished creating each plot it shows all plots together, creating a cool rainbow effect.
